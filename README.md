phpDemo - Create by Bradley Latreille 
-------------------------------------
An application that demonstrates my ability to use PHP and MySQLi. The app lets you Add, Delete, and View entires into the database. I have also included two buttons that will let you create the database and the database_table. This way you do not have to manually create a database and table to use the project out of the box. 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
I am using a localhost to run this applicaiton. 
username: 'root'; 
password: ''; 
Database: phpmyadmin 
DemoAPPDatabasename: users

HOW TO DEPLOY APP: 
1. Download the repo and move the phpDemo folder to your root directory. 

2. run the following into your url assuming you are using a localhost 
localhost/phpDemo 

3. Create the database FIRST 

4. Create the table SECOND 

5. Easily Add, Delete, and View your entries to the database.
